## Projects Overview

---

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline — Day 3

**Directory:** [`Mini_Project_4`](./Mini_Project_4)

A complete CI/CD pipeline implementation using **GitHub Actions** built around a Python Calculator application. This project demonstrates how automated pipelines enforce code quality and testing on every commit.

#### What it does

- Runs **pytest** unit tests automatically on every push and pull request
- Performs **pylint** static code analysis to enforce code quality standards
- Validates that all calculator functions (add, subtract) behave correctly before merging

#### Pipeline Flow

```
Developer pushes code
        |
        v
  GitHub Actions triggered
        |
        +---> Checkout code
        |
        +---> Install dependencies (pytest, pylint)
        |
        +---> Run pylint (code quality check)
        |
        +---> Run pytest (unit tests)
        |
        v
  Pass / Fail reported on commit
```

#### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/CI.yml` | GitHub Actions pipeline definition |
| `Calculator/calculator.py` | Calculator module with add and subtract functions |
| `Calculator/test_calculator.py` | Pytest test cases for both functions |

#### Concepts Covered

- GitHub Actions workflow syntax (`on`, `jobs`, `steps`)
- Automated testing with pytest
- Static analysis with pylint
- Branch-level CI enforcement

---

### 2. Dockerised To-Do API

**Directory:** [`Mini_Project_3`](./Mini_Project_3)

A **production-ready, containerized REST API** for to-do management built with Python Flask, multi-stage Docker builds, and Gunicorn as the WSGI server. Designed to be deployed on Docker Hub, Kubernetes, or any container orchestration platform.

#### Architecture

```
Multi-Stage Docker Build
--------------------------

Stage 1 — Builder
  Python 3.13-slim base
  Install build tools (gcc)
  Compile and cache dependencies

Stage 2 — Runtime
  Lightweight Python 3.13-slim
  Copy pre-built wheels from Stage 1
  Non-root user execution (appuser)
  Health check configuration
  Gunicorn production server (4 workers)

Result: ~150MB image (down from ~1GB)
```

#### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/health` | Service health check |
| GET | `/todos` | List all todos (paginated) |
| GET | `/todos/{id}` | Retrieve a single todo |
| POST | `/todos` | Create a new todo |
| PUT | `/todos/{id}` | Update an existing todo |
| DELETE | `/todos/{id}` | Delete a single todo |
| DELETE | `/todos` | Delete all todos |

#### Performance Benchmarks

```
Benchmark: ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://localhost:5000/health

Requests per second : 1,250 req/sec
Mean response time  : 8ms
p95 response time   : < 100ms
Container startup   : < 2s
Image size          : ~150MB
```

#### Security Measures

- Non-root container execution (`appuser`)
- Minimal base image (Python slim) — reduced attack surface
- Build tools excluded from production image
- Secrets isolated via `.env` (excluded from git and Docker context)
- Automatic health-check restart on failure

#### Concepts Covered

- Multi-stage Docker builds for optimized image size
- Gunicorn WSGI production server configuration
- Docker Compose for local orchestration
- Makefile-based build automation
- Semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`)
- Docker Hub image publishing

### 3. Git Workflow Simulator

**Directory:** [`Git_Worflow_Simulator`](./Git_Worflow_Simulator)

A documentation-first project that models a **professional GitHub collaboration workflow** for a 3-person engineering team. It codifies branching strategies, pull request standards, code ownership, and release tagging.

#### Team Workflow Model

```
main (protected)
  |
  +--- feature/123-add-user-guide    (Developer A)
  |         |
  |         +--> Pull Request --> Code Review (Developer B)
  |                                   |
  |                              Approved --> Merge --> main
  |
  +--- bugfix/234-fix-typo           (Developer A)
  |
  +--- hotfix/345-patch-build-error  (Release Manager)
```

#### Branch Protection Rules Demonstrated

| Rule | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Require pull request before merge | No direct pushes to `main` |
| Require 1-2 approving reviews | Enforces peer code review |
| Require passing status checks | CI must pass before merge |
| Dismiss stale approvals | Forces re-review after new commits |
| Require branches to be up to date | Prevents out-of-date merges |

#### Release Tagging Strategy

```
v1.0.0   Initial release
v1.1.0   New functionality (backward compatible)
v1.1.1   Bug fix
v2.0.0   Breaking changes
```

#### Repository Components

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` | Standardized PR checklist for all contributors |
| `.github/CODEOWNERS` | Automatic reviewer assignment by file path |
| `workflow-simulator.py` | Script that prints the complete team workflow steps |

#### Concepts Covered

- Feature branch naming conventions
- Pull request lifecycle and code review process
- Conflict resolution via rebase and merge
- CODEOWNERS for automatic reviewer routing
- Semantic versioning and release tagging

### 5. Kubernetes Autoscaling — Day 4

**Directory:** [`Mini_Project_8`](./Mini_Project_8)

A complete **Kubernetes autoscaling setup** demonstrating Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with Metrics Server integration. The application is containerized with Nginx and deployed via a Kubernetes Deployment manifest.

#### Scaling Architecture

```
                         CPU load increases
                                |
                                v
                    HPA monitors CPU utilization
                    (target: 80% average)
                                |
                +---------------+---------------+
                |                               |
         Below threshold                 Above threshold
                |                               |
         Scale down to min                Scale up pods
         (minReplicas: 2)           (up to maxReplicas: 8)

Metrics Server  <---  kubelet  <---  Node resource usage
(kube-system namespace)
```

#### Kubernetes Resources

| Resource | Name | Namespace | Purpose |
|----------|------|-----------|---------|
| Deployment | `my-app` | default | Runs the Nginx application with 3 replicas |
| HPA | `my-app` | default | Auto-scales pods between 2-8 based on CPU |
| Metrics Server | `metrics-server` | kube-system | Collects node and pod resource metrics |
| APIService | `v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io` | cluster-wide | Registers metrics API with the API server |

#### HPA Configuration

```
Scale Target : my-app Deployment
Min Replicas : 2
Max Replicas : 8
Scale Metric : CPU Utilization
Threshold    : 80% average across all pods
```

#### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Step 1 — Build Docker image
docker build -t my-app:latest -f dockerfile .

# Step 2 — Install Metrics Server (required for HPA)
kubectl apply -f components.yaml

# Step 3 — Deploy the application
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

# Step 4 — Enable autoscaling
kubectl apply -f hpa.yaml

# Step 5 — Watch HPA in action
kubectl get hpa my-app --watch
```

#### Concepts Covered

- Kubernetes Deployments and replica management
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with CPU-based scaling
- Metrics Server installation and APIService registration
